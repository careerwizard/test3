    <p class="info1">Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies principles of chemistry, physics, and mathematics to
        design, develop, and optimize processes that involve the transformation of raw materials into valuable products.
        It combines scientific knowledge with engineering principles to solve complex problems and improve industrial
        processes.<br><br>

        Chemical engineers work in a wide range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, energy, food
        and beverages, environmental engineering, and materials manufacturing. They are involved in the development and
        improvement of processes for chemical reactions, separation techniques, and product formulation.<br><br>

        One key aspect of chemical engineering is process design and optimization. Chemical engineers analyze and
        evaluate chemical processes to maximize efficiency, productivity, and safety. They consider factors such as
        reaction kinetics, heat and mass transfer, equipment design, and control systems to ensure the optimal operation
        of the processes.<br><br>

        Chemical engineers also play a significant role in environmental sustainability. They work on developing and
        implementing cleaner and greener technologies, minimizing waste generation, and reducing the environmental
        impact of industrial processes. They contribute to the development of renewable energy sources and work on
        projects related to pollution control and waste treatment.<br><br></p>
