        Design and Development: Mechanical engineering involves the design, development, and improvement of mechanical
        systems, machines, and devices. This includes creating detailed designs, selecting appropriate materials, and
        considering factors like functionality, safety, and aesthetics.<br><br>

        Analysis and Simulation: Mechanical engineers utilize computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering
        (CAE) tools to analyze and simulate the behavior of mechanical systems. This allows them to assess performance,
        optimize designs, and predict how systems will operate under different conditions.<br><br>

        Energy and Power: Mechanical engineering encompasses the study of energy conversion and power generation.
        Engineers work on designing efficient systems that convert various forms of energy, such as thermal, mechanical,
        and electrical, into useful work. This includes areas such as engines, turbines, power plants, and renewable
        energy systems.<br><br>

        Mechanics and Dynamics: Understanding the principles of mechanics and dynamics is fundamental to mechanical
        engineering. Engineers analyze forces, motion, and the behavior of materials to ensure structural integrity,
        stability, and functionality of mechanical systems. This knowledge is applied in areas such as machine design,
        robotics, and vehicle dynamics.<br><br>
